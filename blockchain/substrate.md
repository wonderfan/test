# Substate

Substrate builds upon the achievements from the major blockchain protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum and uses the lessons learned to give developers the latest technology to build flexible blockchains.

Architected on industry-standard WebAssembly
Highly extensible Libp2p networking
Rust-based primary implementation for speed and reliability
Javascript secondary implementation for developability
Wasm WebAssembly interpreter, written in Rust

The runtime of a blockchain is the business logic that defines its behavior. In Substrate-based chains, the runtime is referred to as the “state transition function”; it is where Substrate developers define the storage items that are used to represent the blockchain’s state as well as the functions that allow blockchain users to make changes to this state.

Substrate runtime modules and Substrate smart contracts are two different approaches to building “decentralized applications” using the Substrate framework.Substrate gives blockchain innovators the framework for maximum freedom with minimal effort. It is highly customizable, adaptable, and made by blockchain developers for blockchain developers. It allows developers to focus their effort on the thing they care most about — the state transition function — while providing them with the networking, consensus and security as well as an upgrade path to interoperability with Polkadot.
