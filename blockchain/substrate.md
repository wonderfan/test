# Substate

Substrate builds upon the achievements from the major blockchain protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum and uses the lessons learned to give developers the latest technology to build flexible blockchains.

Architected on industry-standard WebAssembly
Highly extensible Libp2p networking
Rust-based primary implementation for speed and reliability
Javascript secondary implementation for developability
Wasm WebAssembly interpreter, written in Rust

The runtime of a blockchain is the business logic that defines its behavior. In Substrate-based chains, the runtime is referred to as the “state transition function”; it is where Substrate developers define the storage items that are used to represent the blockchain’s state as well as the functions that allow blockchain users to make changes to this state.
