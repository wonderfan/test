## Request Limit

In the first part of source code, the data types and function prototypes are defined. The function implementations are declared in the following part. The functions are grouped into command list. The type variables are instantialized by literal statement.The request limit handler is created to enforce the request limit. The input parameter is http request type. The http request is standed by a struct type.

The memory is allocated in the unit of pool. The data types of network are defined in the network interface file. The data and its operations are defined in the same source code file.

In computing, a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g. assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.
